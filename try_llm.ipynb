      "Although impressive progress has been made through the years, falls, and especially\n",
      "their prediction, still remain serious issues nowadays. In this context, the development of\n",
      "technologies aimed to predict suspect postural behaviors plays a fundamental role.\n",
      "In the following, a brief review of the state of the art, addressing the development of\n",
      "solutions for postural sway monitoring, is given. The very ﬁrst classiﬁcation key among\n",
      "different solutions already available or under development consists of the two main classes:\n",
      "infrastructure-dependent devices and wearable systems [3–6]. The actual approaches\n",
      "adopted in diagnostic premises exploit force platforms and/or vision systems [3,4]. In [3],\n",
      "a force plate and inertial sensor are suggested to monitor the center of pressure (COP)\n",
      "and multiscale entropy was used to detect fractal correlations and assess data complexity.\n",
      "Analysis of the main features to assess postural stability, including COP displacement,\n",
      "equilibrium score, and other postural stability indexes are discussed in [5], along with the\n",
      "equipment (force plate, balance master, and equitest) adopted to achieve above information.\n",
      "Recent works investigated the possibility to use a Kinect vision system to study\n",
      "postural stability features or to localize the center of mass (CoM) of an upright person [5,6].\n",
      "Although very accurate, the main limit of such infrastructure-dependent solutions is\n",
      "represented by the need to perform periodic laboratory tests, which lead to a discontinuous\n",
      "monitoring of the patient. With the aim of continuously monitoring potential postural\n",
      "instability, a different approach is required. As an example, a wearable device could be used\n",
      "to collect information useful for analyzing the postural sway. Among wearable systems, the\n",
      "most popular devices are instrumented insoles [7] and inertial-sensor-based systems [8–10].\n",
      "Insoles represent a valuable solution for the monitoring of the Centre of Pressure (CoP),\n",
      "although not always easy to use and to maintain [6,7].\n",
      "Wearable IMU-based solutions are nowadays recognized as reference tools for the\n",
      "monitoring of postural sway [11]. A review of the main approaches using IMU is presented\n",
      "in [12]. A solution based on an inertial sensor positioned on the posterior trunk at the\n",
      "level of the L5 lumbar vertebra is discussed in [13], with a speciﬁc focus on the system\n",
      "validation against reference tools (e.g., a force plate). An approach based on a tri-axial\n",
      "accelerometer to quantitatively classify PD patients into motor subtypes is investigated\n",
      "in [14]. A head-mounted wearable IMU and different proposed measures of postural sway\n",
      "are proposed in [15]. A recent work aimed to assess the validity of a solution based on\n",
      "the use of an IMU sensor in a pendant worn around the neck [16]. Other approaches also\n",

      "two further approaches. Time-based features directly estimated by tri-axial inertial sensors\n",

      "used to implement a postural sway assessment strategy. The work exploited a threshold\n",
      "algorithm to distinguish among stable and unstable postural behaviors. The main limitation\n",
      "of this approach is related to the difﬁculty of ﬁnding a robust element of separation among\n",
      "different classes of postural behaviors, which may affect the assessment reliability.\n",
      "Despite the good performance of time-based approaches, the exploitation of the\n",

      "searchers [23,24]. This is justiﬁed due to the understanding that increased postural move-\n",
      "ments do not necessarily indicate destabilization. Indeed, since pieces of information on\n",
      "postural sway are hidden in different timescales, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)\n",

      "This paper proposes a comparison among different techniques for the detection of\n",
      "the potential status of postural instability, exploiting a wearable sensing node, along with\n",
      "threshold-based algorithms or NF-based inference systems.\n",
      "This task is strategic to allow for the continuous and real-time monitoring of the\n",
      "postural sway in elderly people and users affected by neurologic diseases, such as PD.\n",
      "As demonstrated by the results shown in Table 3, the adopted algorithms perform very\n",
      "well in distinguishing among stable and unstable behaviors. Apparently, the performance\n",
      "of the three methodologies is also comparable in terms of reliability. However, the investi-\n",
      "gation developed in Section 4.4 demonstrated that NF-based strategies are characterized by\n",
      "better performance in terms of reliability, especially in the presence of noisy data.\n",
      "Although not easy to implement in microcontroller-based architecture, NF inference\n",
      "systems perform better than the threshold-based algorithm. This being said, a convenient\n",
      "approach could be to validate the threshold-based real-time estimation of postural sway by\n",
      "implementing a data fusion strategy, which exploits the NF inference running off-line on a\n",
      "dedicated (cloud) server.\n",
      "The presented analysis encourages further developments of the proposed strategies.\n",
      "Further efforts will be dedicated to test the proposed methodologies by using a larger\n",
      "dataset and involving end-users. Moreover, the implementation of the NF detection\n",
      "paradigms into an embedded system will also be addressed, with the aim of performing a\n",
      "more reliable real-time detection of potential postural instability during the everyday life\n",
