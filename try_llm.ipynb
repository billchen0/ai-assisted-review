      "indicator of teenagers’ physical fitness condition, with better results for predicting\n",
      "excellent and poor levels. Intermediate health levels are a bit harder to assess. The\n",
      "experiment results indicate that people can monitor physical fitness condition of\n",
      "adolescents by analyzing their physiological recordings with modern artificial intelligence\n",
      "methods.\n",
      "Through mathematical calculation, MF-WT denoising, and PCC value analyses, we\n",
      "finalized the physiological feature set for boys and girls, respectively. Considering the\n",
      "one-dimensional nature, and time correlation, of physiological signals, computing ability,\n",
      "and dimension reduction processing ability of deep learning, we applied 1D-CNN with\n",
      "LSTM to achieve the classified task and got 98.27% (for boys) and 99.26% (for girls) as the\n",
      "final prediction results. Notably, whereas, ideally, it is expected to collect physiological\n",
      "recordings from all items of the student physical fitness test, on the guidance of official\n",
      "documents published by the government, for the prediction of health condition, our data\n",
      "were measured merely by a typical running test. Although cardiopulmonary function can\n",
      "be detected through long-distance running, and running is easier to monitor than sports\n",
      "such as those requiring sitting forward flexion, we admit that if combined with more\n",
      "physical tests, the results can be more accurate. Furthermore, the accuracy of the\n",
      "evaluation model, based on the current method, has reached the commercial level, but if\n",
